Who the heck is he and why should I listen to him?

- This is a very valid question, so let me start with my background.

## Career Background

I began developing websites in highschool as I completed all of my available courses by 11th grade. Web Development always fascinated me, i'm sure my Father
was a large influence as he has ran Digital Marketing companies my entire life.

23 years later and i'm now one of the most sought after Digital Marketing and Technical Operations consultant in Ohio.

My background has always been under the "Marketing" umbrella. In my old "9-5" job I ran:

- Technical Marketing

  - Google Analytics
  - Google Tag Manager
  - VWO
  - HotJar
  - MS Clarity
  - Google Looker
  - Heap
  - CrazyEgg
  - Google AdWords
    - Just about every PPC tool currently in use (Bing, Yahoo Ads, LinkedIn, etc)

- **Marketing**

  Having recently completed my Marketing MBA I have an excellent grasp on Marketing as a whole.

  - Content Creation
  - Brand Strategy
  - Building and Developing Brands from scratch.
  - Restructuring current Brand strategies that are not working.
  - Campaign Creation

- **Web Development**

I have a understanding of all of the current JS frameworks (despite my distane for one.) I work with a number of different companies in various roles. I'm typically called in to course correct a project that has gone off track.

This can be difficult as company stakeholders will believe they have answers for everything.

In my current role I debug, fix, document and impove current solutions. I also build out solutions and System Artchitect for companies looking to get off the ground.

**Why am I the best?**

- I focus on the user and how I can improve their experience.
- Performance is absolutely essential, what most companies and 3rd party contractors provide is garbage. Most companies don't realize they are being taken for a ride by some of the big name Digital Agencies out there.

- I returned to school in 2019 and received my Full Stack Web Development certificate from Case Western Reserve.
- I have valid qualifications in the following:
  - Google Analytics GA4
  - Google Core Web Vitals
  - Google Tag Manager
  - Google Looker
  - PEN 200: Penetration testing with Kali Linux

My ability to combine my marketing and web expertise solve solutions or ideally prevent them before they break is where I shine.

### What should I see on a site

- User first development (Progressive Enhancement)
- Critical CSS
- Next Generation image formats
- Lazy loading images
- Service Workers
- Non Render Blocking Code
- A site the size of the original Doom game.
- Secure Systems!
